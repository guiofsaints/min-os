Installing

PREFACE

On devices that support two SD cards NextUI will generally end up being installed on the "secondary" one. All instances of "SD card" or "primary card" refer to the card that goes into the second slot or to the sole SD card of devices that only support a single card. 

Please refer to https://nextui.loveretro.games/usage/#getting-started for detailed instructions that might differ slightly between devices.

In general, just copy all the folders from this zip file to the root of your primary card.

----------------------------------------
Updating

This extras zip file is included with every release, regardless of whether its contents has changed or not. Refer to the release notes to see what, if anything, was added or changed and copy just the desired updated pak(s) to the corresponding device folder in the Emus or Tools folders (eg. /Emus/tg5040 or /Tools/tg5040)

----------------------------------------
Bios files

You'll need to bring your own BIOS files for the emulator paks included in this zip file. Please refer to https://nextui.loveretro.games/usage/#required-bios for the correct file names and locations.
